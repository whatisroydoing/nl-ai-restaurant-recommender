# Phase 3 — LLM Integration and Explained Recommendations

Phase 3 will add an LLM layer (OpenAI) to turn a bounded candidate set into ranked recommendations with short explanations, with a robust fallback when the LLM fails.

## Do you need an API key now?

**Not for writing the PRD or building the code structure.**

You’ll only need `OPENAI_API_KEY` when you want to run real OpenAI calls (e.g. an integration test).
